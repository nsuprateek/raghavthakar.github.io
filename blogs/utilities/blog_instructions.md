# How to make a blog post

the blog_template.html file is a boilerplate for all blog posts.

Make a new folder with the name as the date of the post. Create a new html file with the name as the date of the post. Past the boilerplate html
code onto it.

run:

```
python3 md_to_html.py <path_to_md.md> <path_to_html.html>
```

Copy the contents of this new html file into the html file you created with name as the date of the post and you're done.
